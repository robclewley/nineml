NineML is a simulator independent language with the aim of providing an unambiguous description of neuronal network models for efficient model sharing and reusability.

This language has emerged from a joint effort of experts in the fields of computational neuroscience, simulator development and simulator-independent language initiatives (NeuroML, PyNN), grouped in the INCF Multiscale Modeling Task Force. This effort was initiated and is still supported by the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF), as part of the standardization effort of the Multiscale Modeling Program, but the project is now run as a community project, with an elected editorial board.
